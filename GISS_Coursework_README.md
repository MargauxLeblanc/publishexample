## CASA0005 Coursework: A spatial analysis of well-being in London, UK

This spatial analysis and report are part of an assignment for UCL CASA0005 “Geographic Information Systems and Science”.

This project explores the spatial distribution and measurement of well-being in London, UK. 
It examines the relationships between London wards' well-being scores (as measured by Greater London Authority), and their median household income and population density.
The analysis utilises linear and Geographically Weighted Regressions to assess these variables’ potential in enhancing the GLA well-being index.
